The earth is simply too big, and doesn't have a big enough gravitational pull, such that travelling this fast requires being below the surface of the earth. Of course, even if you could somehow phase through the earth and orbit at this altitude, it still wouldn't work, because the assumption that all of Earth's mass is located at its center would no longer be valid."

    "\n",
    "The reason a geosynchronous orbit is not exactly 24 hours is that the earth does not rotate at 24 hours per revolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain this, note first that the earth orbits the sun counterclockwise, and rotates counterclockwise. Then, imagine an extremely exaggerated situation where it takes the earth 4 seconds to do a full revolution, whereas it takes 16 seconds to do a full rotation of the sun. Then, suppose at time $t=0$ seconds, we are standing at a point on the earth that faces the sun, which is to the earth's left (we are imagining this in a 2D coordinate system in the plane of the earth's orbit). At time $t=1$, we are now facing downwards, whereas the sun is down and to the left. At time $t=2$, we are facing rightwards, whereas the sun is down and to our left. At time $t=3$, we are facing upwards, whereas the sun is down and to our left, and at time $t=4$, we are facing rightwards again, whereas the sun is down. At this point, we have make a sidereal orbit, however, a day has not passed yet, as we have not faced the sun since $t=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we see that the amount of time it takes the earth to make a full orbit (which is what we care about for a geosynchronous orbit) is *less than* the actual length of a day, due to the orbit of the earth. Since the orbit of the earth is much less exaggerated than we presented in this example, the difference is not as obvious, but there is still a subtle difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the actual altitude of the orbit, this will make a relatively small difference, since the relative change in the period is on the order of $10^{-3}$, meaning that it will cause a relative change in altitude on the order of about $10^{-2}$, which corresponds to a change of about $10^5$ meters."
